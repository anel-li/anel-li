Hi, I’m @anel-li

I’m interested in data workflows, from gathering data, cleaning, organizing, structuring, analysing and visualising it - it's telling a story!
currently I'm enhancing my programming skills, working with R mainly, adding python stepwise, involving other tools when it suits the research question,
the data suggests it or a nice sneak preview was so tempting to figure it out...
