Hi, I’m @anel-li

I’m interested in data... data workflows, from gathering data, structuring, cleaning, shaping, organizing, analysing and visualising it - it's telling a story!
currently I'm enhancing my programming skills, working with R and python mainly, but involving other tools when it suits the research question best,
the data needs it or a nice  sneak preview was tempting to figure it out
